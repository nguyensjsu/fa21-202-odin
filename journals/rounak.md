XP Core Value: **Simplicity**

## Week 1 (Nov. 14, 2021)

### What tasks did I work on / complete?

- Worked on exploring different project ideas
- Did preliminary research on feasibility of project
- Had a team meeting to discuss project idea
  - Finalized on search algorithm visualization project using Processing
  - Assigned XP roles

### What am I planning to work on next?

- Play around with Processing to understand how to use it for our project

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

- None

### XP Core Value Analysis

In our group meeting we first decided on the project so that we had a clear definition of what the "ask" is. We then proceeded to break down certain starter tasks into the simplicity manner possible that will help us move forward with our project.

We decided to follow it up with another meeting as soon as we had a picture of how we could use the Processing library for our project. This way our team is working on small and simple tasks that are directly related to the goal of the project and we are avoiding doing any extra work.

## Week 2 (Nov. 18, 2021)

### What tasks did I work on / complete?

- Played around with Processing
- Team meeting
  - Team was in agreement of using Processing for this project and we discussed some high level strategies and ideas

### What am I planning to work on next?

- Explore getting Processing bare-bones project working with Maven
  - Hussein is also exploring using Java files directly with a `.pde` file - can go with this approach since we don't have to worry about different machine architecture issue for M1 Mac
- Implement strategy pattern for search along with BFS and DFS search
  - Get basic UI proof of concept working

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

- None

### XP Core Value Analysis

Once again in our group meeting we broke the pending tasks into the smallest steps possible. As a team we have been focussed on getting a basic proof of concept up and running before moving forward. We are ensuring that there is no extra or redundant work being done.
