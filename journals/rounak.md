### XP Core Value Analysis
In our group meeting we first decided on the project so that we had a clear definition of what the "ask" is. We then proceeded to break down certain starter tasks into the simplicity manner possible that will help us move forward with our project.

We decided to follow it up with another meeting as soon as we had a picture of how we could use the Processing library for our project. This way our team is working on small and simple tasks that are directly related to the goal of the project and we are avoiding doing any extra work.
