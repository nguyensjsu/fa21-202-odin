XP core value: communication

## Week 1 (Nov. 14, 2021)
- Met at 4pm to finalize project idea
- Project is a search algorithm visualizer using the processing library.
- Assigned XP roles

### XP core value analysis
Our group discussed different project ideas prior to meeting. At the meeting, everyone voiced their opinions and communicated their thoughts clearly. 

We planned on having another meeting later in the week; however one member was unable to attend. They communicated their inability to attend, and the meeting was moved by a day.


## Week 2 (Nov. 18, 2021)
- Came up with a plan for future work
- got basic UI (without full functionality)
- split up work for different algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's)
- discussed plans for different patterns
    * strategy for different algorithms
    * chain of responsibility for gui
    * command for buttons

### XP core value analysis
There was open communication between meetings on progress people had made, whether planned or unplanned. I did not complete my component by the next planned meeting, so I requested it be postponed by a day. Because of how we had been communicating between meetings, this did not delay everyone else's progress and they were able to continue working.

## Week 3 (Nov. 23, 2021)
- Assigned final work
    * architecture diagram
    * bug fixes
    * video and slides
- Verfied state and command patterns worked correctly
- Verified UI functionality and integration
    * changing algorithm state and search state with buttons
- Discussed plans for slides, video demo, presentation

### XP core value analysis
There was ongoing communication throughout the week over Slack. When new bugs were found, tickets wer made on Github and the person who found it would notify the rest of the team. This allowed issues to be solved quickly, with no confusion surrounding who was working on what.
