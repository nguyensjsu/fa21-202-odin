## Meeting Notes

#### November 14th, 2021

- Project proposal:
   - Search algorithms visualization
   - https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/


- Proposed technologies: Processing, Java

- Suggested algorithms to implement:
    - BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s (strategy pattern?)
    - Adding new algos should be easy

- Patterns that can be used in the project:
    - Strategy pattern for different search algorithms
    - State pattern to indicate current state of search
    - Possibly observer for displaying the animation
    - Possibly command pattern for menu items to select search

 - XP core values
    - Aidan: Communication
    - Hussein: Respect
    - Rounak: Simplicity
    - Daniel: Feedback
